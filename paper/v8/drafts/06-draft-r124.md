## The second half: cruise carried on a wing

### The opponent, and the axis

On this axis the alternative is the rotorcraft, multirotor and helicopter alike, and as in the previous section the comparison
runs one way only. **Nothing here is claimed against fixed-wing aircraft.** The claim is
confined to the one thing the rotorcraft family structurally lacks: **a surface that carries the
cruise lift.**

### What the requirement is

Section 5 established the first half: the aircraft must leave from and return to a site that
supplies nothing. **A rotorcraft meets that requirement completely.**

What it does not meet is the second half of both missions. Wildfire observation and response,
and cargo delivery to places without a runway, each require the aircraft to **cover distance
after it has left the unprepared site**, and a vehicle with no wing buys every second of that
distance with installed power. The consequence has been stated independently: surveying the
field, one study concludes that multirotors are efficient in hover and suited to short-range
missions, while vectored-thrust aircraft are efficient in cruise and suited to long-range ones.

### What the configuration does instead

**Cruise lift is carried by the airframe itself.** There is no separate fuselage: the whole
planform is the wing, so every part of the body that is carried is also a part that lifts. At
the cruise condition the lift coefficient follows from `C_L = W/(qS)`, the drag from
`C_D = C_D0 + C_L²/(πARe)`, and the nose pair is left with one job — producing the thrust that
balances that drag. It supports none of the weight.

**A rotorcraft's rotors must produce the lift and the propulsive force
together, throughout cruise.** This aircraft separates them: a surface holds the aircraft up and a
propeller pushes it along, and **the wing produces its lift without a separate continuous power
supply of its own** — the power the aircraft spends in cruise goes to overcoming drag, of which
the lift's share is the induced part.

**But the size of the resulting advantage is a calculation, not a consequence of that
statement**. The rest of this section is the calculation,
and it gives a smaller number than the structural statement invites.

### What the margin actually is, in one currency

The sizing set of Section 4 reports an **effective lift-to-drag ratio**, defined in its own
nomenclature as `L/De = WV/P`: weight times speed over power. That is a system figure of merit,
not a force ratio, and it already contains the propulsive efficiency of whatever produces the
thrust. **A force ratio cannot be placed beside it.**

Converting this configuration's aerodynamic ratio into the same quantity is one line: in level
cruise thrust equals drag and lift equals weight, so with shaft power `P = DV/η_p`,

> **L/De = WV/P = (L/D) · η_p**

**Which power `P` denotes is not assumed here**, because reading it as electrical power rather
than shaft power would make this configuration's figure incomparable with the published one. The source settles it: hover power is written with the
figure of merit already applied — shaft power — and the propulsion-system efficiency applied
separately outside it. That separation holds for the all-electric entries as well as the shaft-driven ones.

**Neither factor is a single number, and they are two different kinds of spread.**

The aerodynamic ratio is **8.79 to 10.82**, with the tip frames and the free-wheeling attitude
rotors already charged. That spread is **uncertainty**: it is the zero-lift drag bracket, and a
designer does not get to choose where in it the real aircraft lands.

The cruise propeller efficiency is **0.632 to 0.683** across the nose-blade families that meet
the hover figure of merit. That spread is **not
uncertainty**: it is a design variable this study has not fixed.

| L/De | η_p 0.632 | η_p 0.683 |
|---|---:|---:|
| **L/D 8.79** (adverse drag) | 5.56 | 6.00 |
| **L/D 10.82** (favourable drag) | 6.84 | 7.39 |

**These are the bounding corners of a product, not four simulated aircraft.** Two readings follow
and both are given, because choosing between them requires something this section does not have:

- **Examined envelope, 5.56 to 7.39.** **The four corners are not demonstrated aircraft
  states**, and nothing here
  shows that a built aircraft would land simultaneously on both bounds.
- **Best examined blade family, 6.00 to 7.39.** The highest efficiency among the families
  examined is 0.683; holding it and sweeping only the drag bracket gives this range.

**Whether 0.683 is the blade a designer would actually choose is not settled here**. It is the best *on cruise efficiency under the hover figure-of-merit
constraint*. Blade count and section loading also govern structural loads, acoustics, the motor
operating point, rotor inertia and manufacture, and **none of those is modelled in this work**.
Section 10 is where one blade is carried into a closed sizing loop; until then this section stays
at envelope level and does not present any corner as the aircraft's performance.

### What the comparison gives, against both published quadrotors

The sizing set contains two quadrotors for the same mission, and **neither is treated here as the
primary one.**

| | L/De | vs examined envelope 5.56 – 7.39 | vs best examined family 6.00 – 7.39 |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Quadrotor, turboshaft | 4.9 | +13 % … +51 % | **+22 % … +51 %** |
| Quadrotor, all-electric | 5.8 | −4 % … +27 % | **+3 % … +27 %** |

**Against the turboshaft quadrotor the sign holds at every corner of both readings.** Closing it
would need the propeller efficiency to fall to 0.557, against 0.632 for the least efficient blade
family examined.

**Against the all-electric quadrotor it does not hold at the low corner**, and that result is
reported as a result rather than as a caveat. That vehicle reaches 5.8 — above this
configuration's 5.56 — and it buys the difference with 1 742 lb of battery and nearly twice the
gross weight for the same mission, 7 221 lb against 3 678 lb. **That higher gross weight is
consistent with the mass charge Section 2 describes**, and Section 4 is where the independent
sizing evidence for it is set out — the comparison in this table does not establish the causal
link by itself. On cruise efficiency taken alone, the entry is ahead of this configuration's low
corner.

The same sizing set gives its two helicopter types at 5.4 to 7.2, and against them the result is
mixed: this configuration is ahead of the turboshaft single-main-rotor helicopter at every corner,
the two middle entries fall inside its envelope, and only its top corner is ahead of the
all-electric side-by-side helicopter, which has no wing either. The qualifications below apply to
these entries as they do to the quadrotors.

**So the second claim is narrower than the structural statement invites.** Carrying cruise lift on
a wing is worth **roughly a quarter to a half against the turboshaft reference, and against the
all-electric one it ranges from slightly behind to comfortably ahead depending on the drag outcome
and the blade** — a measurable advantage, not a change of category. And what
compresses it is not the wing. **It is the cruise efficiency this aircraft's fixed-pitch blade
delivers:** at a propeller efficiency of 0.85 the same airframe reaches 7.47 to 9.20. Whether a
variable-pitch hub would recover that difference is not computed; Section 11 reports the gap and
declines to attribute all of it to the hub.

### Five qualifications: three run against this configuration, one has no computed direction, and one bounds what the comparison can be called

They are given together because omitting any one of them would make the comparison look better
than it is.

**Scale.** The compared vehicles are 1 660 to 3 275 kg; the designs here are of order 50 kg and
1 000 kg — Section 10 closes the light one between 52.3 and 57.5 kg across the same bracket.
Reynolds number favours the larger aircraft, so the smaller design is at a disadvantage in this
comparison rather than an advantage.

**The quadrotor is a good quadrotor.** Its disc loading is 3.5 lb ft⁻², and the all-electric one's
is 3; both are unusually low. Nothing here is compared against a poor example.

**The speeds are not matched, and the direction of that mismatch is calculable.** The published
figure is quoted at the best-range speed; this configuration's is at its chosen cruise condition,
1.49 times stall, which Section 10 states explicitly is **not** its best lift-to-drag point. The
best point lies at 1.26 times stall, and `L/D_max` exceeds the cruise ratio at both ends of the drag bracket.
**The reference is
therefore given its best speed and this configuration is not given its best speed, and the margin
is positive anyway.** The best point is not an available option — cruising there leaves too little
margin above the stall — so this fixes a direction, not a magnitude.

**The atmospheres are not matched.** The published sizing mission is flown at *"5,000-ft altitude
and ISA + 20°C"*; every number in this work is at sea level, with a sea-level drag polar and a
sea-level blade solution. **The direction of that mismatch is not claimed here**, because it has
not been computed: the altitude sweep in this work measured the effect on hover power and on
propeller efficiency, not on a cruise comparison at a re-trimmed best-range speed.

**The analysis chains are not matched, and this is the qualification that bounds what the
comparison can be called.** The published value is the output of an integrated conceptual-design
system with a comprehensive rotor analysis behind its rotor performance. The value here is
assembled from a drag build-up, a drag polar at a prescribed cruise condition, and a separate
blade-element propeller solution. There is a second difference inside that one: **the published
value is the effective ratio of a fully sized vehicle, while the value here is a converted
performance metric at a prescribed cruise condition, taken before the sizing closure Section 10
reports.** So this is a comparison of two independently produced figures in a common definition,
not a controlled numerical reproduction, and nothing in it should be read as validation of either,
or as a completed aircraft-level comparison.

### What is sized, and what is not demonstrated

**Sized.** The drag build-up and its bracket; the lift-to-drag ratio at the cruise condition
from the drag polar; the propeller efficiency from blade-element momentum theory at two
operating points; and the range that follows from the chain, link by link.

**Not demonstrated.** **No part of this has been measured.** There is no wind-tunnel test and no
flight test in this work, and the drag coefficient is a build-up with a declared bracket rather
than a measurement. The planform's sweep, taper and thickness distributions were chosen rather
than optimised. **The span efficiency used throughout this section is the computed value, 0.817,
not the assumed 0.85** — a vortex-lattice solution of the trimmed planform, so the lift-to-drag figures above carry the calculated penalty rather than the
optimistic estimate. And **for the methods used here, and for the published
comparisons against which they were checked, the aerodynamic predictions diverge above roughly ten
degrees of incidence**: three methods of three fidelities depart at the same place, the highest of
them against wind-tunnel measurement. That is a statement about these methods on this class of
configuration, not about what any method could achieve. It does not touch the cruise numbers
above, which sit at a few degrees, but it bounds what this section may be read to support.

### What this half costs

The wing that makes cruise efficient is carried through the vertical phase, where it produces
nothing and presents the aircraft's largest surface to ground wind. The tailless planform that
follows from having no boom constrains the sweep, because with no horizontal stabiliser the
pitching moment must come from the distribution of lift along the body itself. And the
fixed-pitch propeller that serves both regimes is the reason the margin above sits where it does
rather than higher. Section 11 charges all three.

**The two halves are now on the table separately. Section 7 is where they are combined**, and
the combination is what this paper is for.
