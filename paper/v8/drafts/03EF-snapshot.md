# 3E and 3F — frozen snapshot (Round 86; Step 3 after 3A–3D)

### The condition can fail, and how

A definition worth stating is one an architecture can be shown not to meet, so the failure modes
are explicit. An architecture fails the condition if **any** of the following holds:

1. It carries a propulsor through cruise that produces no cruise thrust.
2. It changes the orientation of a propulsor relative to the airframe in order to change regime.
3. Its continuously installed power is sized by the hover requirement rather than by cruise.
4. It satisfies the first three only in part — for instance in its primary propulsor while a
   secondary set fails them — in which case the instantiation is **partial**, and the part that
   fails re-opens the charge it fails.

The fourth is not a technicality, and it is the reason this list exists. **An architecture may
meet the condition where it carries the aircraft and fail it elsewhere**, and a paper that
reported only the first half would be reporting the condition rather than the aircraft.

### What follows from the condition, and what does not

The condition is a statement about what an architecture would have to be. **It is not a claim
that anything satisfies it, not a claim that anything satisfying it would fly, and not a claim
that satisfying it is desirable.** Those are three separate questions and they are answered
separately: whether the accounting behind the condition survives contact with an independent
sizing study is tested in the next section, against data this work did not produce; whether any
configuration satisfies the condition is the subject of Sections 5 to 7; and what such a
configuration pays instead is the subject of Section 11, which is the longest of the three
answers because it is the one most likely to be wrong.

One consequence is worth stating now, because it shapes everything after it. The third departure — same hardware, both duties, different orientation — is refused by a means other than the
one the field has adopted. A tilting architecture accepts that departure and buys its way out of the first with a mechanism. **An architecture that reorients a propulsor does not satisfy the condition as written**, because
the condition requires one orientation relative to the airframe. **Whether such an architecture
might avoid the three charges by some other route is a separate question this paper does not
settle** — the condition is a definition, not a law, and it can be too narrow without being
wrong. What it is not is retrofitted: it is stated here so that when a configuration is offered
later, the reader can check the claim against a standard fixed before the configuration
appeared.
