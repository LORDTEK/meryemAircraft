## The gap

### Two families, two different limits

Uncrewed powered flight is dominated by two configuration families, and neither is bounded by
the thing the other is bounded by.

**Fixed-wing aircraft** carry payload over distance efficiently, because a wing sustains the
vehicle without continuously spending power on lift. Their limit is not aerodynamic but
infrastructural: a runway, a catapult, or an equivalent installation.

**Rotorcraft and multirotors** remove that requirement completely. They take off and land
vertically, hover, and work from confined sites. Their limit is the converse: with no wing,
every second of flight is bought with installed power, so range and endurance stay modest and
worsen as the vehicle grows.

**Neither family is deficient.** Each is limited by the price of
doing it that way. **The corner where both capabilities are wanted at once is where the two
applications this work is aimed at sit** — wildfire observation and response, and cargo delivery to
places without a runway — and both want to leave from an unprepared site and then cover distance.
**That corner is not empty**, as the rest of this section sets out; what is unsettled is which
price an architecture in it must pay, and whether one arrangement pays less than it appears to.

### What the contemporary answers do, and how each changes regime

Hybrid VTOL aircraft occupy that corner today. **This paper does
not dispute that they work.** What matters for the argument is *how* each changes between the
two regimes, because that is where the families differ from one another.

The NASA sizing study used in Section 4 describes the two relevant routes in its own terms.

**The lift-plus-cruise route keeps two sets of hardware and switches between them.** In that
study the configuration is a stopping-rotor compound with three flight modes — helicopter mode
with the lifting rotors turning, compound mode with both sets operating, and aeroplane mode in
which *"the lifting rotors are stopped with the blade axis pointed along the vehicle
longitudinal axis, and therefore nominally aligned with the free stream to minimise drag,"*
with forward thrust from a pusher propeller. The lifting rotors are carried through cruise and
are stopped in the airstream.

**The tilting route keeps one set of hardware and reorients it.** The tilt-wing in the same
study carries six proprotors on a tilting main wing and two more on a tilting tail, each
directly connected to its own electric motor. Nothing is carried unused; the same discs that
lift the aircraft propel it, after being turned.

**Both work, and the second is the more demanding to build**, because rotating a propulsor in
flight brings a pivot and its actuators, a gyroscopic moment during the rotation, and a control
problem through a regime in which the aircraft is neither a rotorcraft nor an aeroplane.
**Those are mechanical and control requirements rather than aerodynamic ones**, and that
distinction is what this paper is built on.

### The third route is established, and some of its difficulties are inherited

There is a third way to put one set of propulsors into both regimes without reorienting them: **point the
thrust line at the ground and let the whole aircraft rotate.** It is neither new nor untried nor abandoned.
The Convair XFY-1 flew it in 1954 and completed six transitions to conventional flight *"before testing was
curtailed because of engine and gear-box reliability problems"*, and uncrewed tail-sitters have revisited the
route continuously since. The pilot's spatial orientation and workload, recorded for that programme, were real
and severe, **but they are not what curtailed the testing**, and they are the only one of those documented
obstacles an uncrewed aircraft removes.

**Some of the difficulties were real, internal, and are inherited here.** A tail-sitting vertical descent is
harder than a runway landing; a tail-sitter on the ground is more exposed to crosswind; and propellers whose
thrust vectors are all parallel to the body axis produce no rolling moment **by any combination of thrust
settings**. The reaction-torque channel that other coaxial tail-sitters use about that axis is a choice this
configuration declines rather than a limit it inherits (Sections 7 and 8).

Three things are available now that were not: electric drive on each individual rotor, sensor-based attitude
reference, and enough onboard computation that stability need not come from the airframe alone. **The uncrewed
tail-sitter literature has been exploiting exactly those three for over a decade**, which is why the gap below is
not a historical one.

### What is already occupied, stated before the gap

**The route itself is established.** Uncrewed tail-sitters combining fixed-pitch rotors with a
flying wing have been built and flown for more than a decade, beginning with quadrotor-plus-wing
arrangements carrying a few aerodynamic actuators for forward flight.

**Attitude without aerodynamic control surfaces is established.** A quadrotor tail-sitter
operated without control surfaces, with experimental verification, was reported in 2013.

**Coaxial contra-rotating propulsion on a tail-sitter is established**, proposed specifically to
remove the reaction torque a single propeller imposes, at the cost of an extra motor and the
coaxial arrangement. A coaxial contra-rotating tail-sitting micro air vehicle reported in 2014
states the same purpose in the same terms: *"a pair of 10 inches coaxial contra rotating
propellers is mounted to compensate each other's torque."*

**The established answer to hover control on such a configuration is a surface in the
slipstream**, and it is worth naming because this paper refuses it. That 2014 vehicle places
*"elevon and rudder … immersed in the propeller slip stream to provide three axis control moments
in hover."* A flying-wing tail-sitter reported in 2018, with two counter-rotating propellers side by side and two
elevons, uses the same answer for two of its three axes and treats the propellers' counter-moment about the thrust axis as
a disturbance to be cancelled rather than as a control channel; only its hover and vertical flight are reported.

**And the reaction-torque channel this paper declines is established as a control channel.** A
coaxial contra-rotating tail-sitter reported in 2012 balances rotor torque *"by the inverse
rotating of the two rotors"* and then unbalances it on purpose to steer: its published control
scheme assigns *"differential velocity of the two motors"* to yaw in the vertical mode and to
roll in the horizontal one. **Those are the same physical channel under two names** — a moment
about the propeller axis, which stands vertical in hover and horizontal in cruise — and
independently driven rotors make it available to any coaxial pair. **Using it is a choice, and
so is declining it**, which is what separates this configuration's control problem from a
physical impossibility.

**A blended-wing-body tail-sitter with contra-rotating propulsion, aimed at disaster response,
is established**, reported in 2025 with vortex-lattice and RANS analysis of its planform,
winglets and transition.

**And the propeller compromise at the centre of this paper's own ledger is a known result, not a
discovery.** The uncrewed tail-sitter literature states it directly: fixed-pitch propellers make
it *"theoretically impossible to be very efficient in both hovering and forward flight."* A
long-range tail-sitter reported in 2018 that uses a cyclic- and collective-pitch rotor still describes it
as *"a compromise between efficient hover and efficient forward flight"* and selects its diameter on
that basis; the same paper names variable pitch as the remedy for fixed-pitch propellers, at the cost of
extra actuators and the weight of the mechanism.

### The gap, stated precisely

**Each half of the required capability is well served, and both halves together are served by
the contemporary hybrids.** This paper does not claim otherwise. **And the third route is
occupied.** What follows is therefore not a claim to an empty field.

**What is not established is the combination taken together with its price.** Specifically:
a blended-wing-body tail-sitter in which *every* propulsor is a coaxial, torque-balanced pair —
so that reaction torque and net angular momentum are given up along with the reorientation
mechanism — carrying no aerodynamic control surfaces beyond a single moving device, powered
through a buffered series hybrid, and **audited explicitly against carried hover mass, exposed
cruise drag and hover-sized continuous power**, the last two of them at two scales, and under three sizing
contracts.

Each of those choices costs something, and **the giving-up is the part that is not free**. A
quadrotor tail-sitter produces a rolling moment from the reaction torque of four independently
driven rotors; a coaxial pair can produce one the same way, by running its two rotors at different
speeds. **Operating every pair torque-balanced spends that channel to buy the torque balance and
the near-zero net angular momentum**, and leaves the axis to a single aerodynamic device.

**None of the elements is new**, and Section 7 says so. Tail-sitting aircraft are seventy years old; blended wing bodies have been a standing subject of transport
research for three decades; series-hybrid propulsion has been flown in a crewed motor glider and designed for small uncrewed aircraft. The route is not claimed to have been waiting to be found. **The contribution is the
architecture: a configuration arranged to change regime by rotating the airframe rather than its
propulsors, and so carrying no mechanism that reorients a propulsor.** The combination, the
consequences of the choices inside it, and an accounting of what they cost are how that contribution
is presented and priced.

Section 2 states the cost that any architecture in this corner pays, in terms that do not
presume an escape.
