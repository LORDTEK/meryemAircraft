## 9. Four axes, and where the paper stops

This section states the boundary of the paper's claims.

**It is not a list of the study's open questions.** Those are in Section 8, and the difference matters: the boundary below is about claims the paper **declines to make**, most of which it could not make on any evidence; Section 8 is about questions the paper **does not answer**, and which better evidence would answer. One is a scope; the other is a debt.

#### The claims are made on four axes, against four different opponents

Comparison is only meaningful against a named alternative, and this paper's alternatives differ from axis to axis.

| Axis | Opponent | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Cruise efficiency | Rotorcraft: multirotors and helicopters | **Claimed against multirotors, and bounded; against helicopters the comparison with published figures is mixed and no advantage is claimed.** Cruise lift is carried on a surface rather than on rotors, which no sizing contract changes. The *size* of the resulting advantage is a calculation, not a consequence of that fact: ⟦positive throughout against one published quadrotor, and from slightly behind to comfortably ahead against the other⟧ (Section 4). |
| Operation without a runway | Fixed-wing aircraft | **Claimed as sized, not demonstrated** (Sections 3, 8). ⟦The vertical phase was sized with an energy store whose required performance the sources consulted here do not report as built.⟧ |
| The mechanism required to change regime | Tilting architectures | **Claimed.** This is the paper's contribution — a count of mechanism classes (Section 5.1), not a claim of mechanical simplicity or reliability. |
| Cruise efficiency and range | Other hybrids — lift-plus-cruise, tilt | **Not claimed, in either direction.** |

**The fourth row is the important one**, and the reason it is a refusal rather than a result is the paper's own finding in Section 7.4. Against lift-plus-cruise the ordering depends on the sizing contract: across the three contracts it moves substantially, and under one of them its sign changes inside the envelope and turns on quantities of the competitor that are assumed rather than measured. A paper that quoted one of those orderings as a result would be reporting its own choice of contract. Against the tilting family the competitor can be modelled here only as a bound that pays no cruise penalty, and an ordering against a bound is not a result. **No range claim is made against the tilting or lift-plus-cruise families in either direction**, and a reader who finds one implied anywhere in this paper should treat it as an error rather than as a claim.

#### What each claim does not depend on

**Operation without a runway** does not depend on the drag bracket, the propeller efficiency or the transition aerodynamics — **but it does depend on the energy store**: the vertical phase is sized with one, and Section 8 examines whether it exists. **Cruise lift carried on a surface** does not depend on the sizing contract or the transition aerodynamics. The **size** of the cruise-efficiency margin depends on both the drag bracket and the blade family, and Section 4 reports it as a range rather than a number. **Elimination of the propulsor-reorientation mechanism class** does not depend on the drag bracket, the propeller efficiency, the sizing contract, the range result or the energy store — **nor on the transition aerodynamics**.

The mechanism claim is a statement about what hardware is present, and it is settled by the inventory of Sections 5.1 and 5.2. **The separate claim that this aircraft can actually perform the regime change is not settled** (Section 5.1).

#### One cost of the contribution that is named and not priced

The mechanism claim has a price this work does not compute. **This configuration declines the reaction-torque channel that comparable aircraft use for roll (Section 5.2). What that refusal costs — in thrust asymmetry, in propulsive efficiency, and in response time set by rotor inertia — is not computed anywhere in this paper.** The claim is that the mechanism class is eliminated. **Whether eliminating it is favourable on balance is a question this work does not settle**, and quantifying it would require a control-allocation study rather than a single torque figure.

#### Eight things this paper does not claim

**1. It does not claim range against fixed-wing aircraft.**

**2. It does not claim vertical capability against rotorcraft.** That comparison runs the other way.

**3. It does not claim that the aircraft has no moving parts.** What is eliminated is a *class of mechanism* — the one that reorients a propulsor. The aircraft has a moving aerodynamic surface, it is named where the elimination is claimed rather than later, and it also pitches the nose down when deployed.

**4. It does not claim mechanical simplicity.** Part count, assembly mass, failure modes and maintenance burden were not measured, and nothing here supports a statement about reliability. The count of mechanism classes in Section 5.1 is not a reliability argument.

**5. It does not claim that the escape condition is fully instantiated.** The condition is met in the propulsor that carries the aircraft and is not met in the attitude system, which is carried through cruise producing moments rather than cruise thrust. Section 2.2 names that case as partial instantiation, and the charge it re-opens is reported rather than absorbed.

**6. It does not claim that satisfying the condition makes an aircraft better.** The condition concerns three specific charges. A configuration may avoid all three and still be unbuildable, uncontrollable, or unsuited to its mission, and the accounting says nothing against that possibility.

**7. It does not claim that the trades inside the escape are favourable.** Moving the hover peak onto a store converts a power-system charge into a cost in kilograms; serving two regimes with one set of fixed-geometry propellers costs efficiency in at least one of them. Both are computed, neither is asserted to be worth paying, and the ledger reports them whichever way they fall.

**8. It does not claim that the aircraft flies.** The design *sizes* vertical operation and the transition; it does not demonstrate either. No aircraft has been built, no wind tunnel has been run on this geometry, and the transition analysis is a calculation whose assumptions are stated where it appears. **"By construction" throughout this paper means "by the sizing", never "by demonstration."**

#### What the claims that remain amount to

Section 8 lists what the paper leaves open. What the paper offers is **a configuration sized to combine runway-independent vertical operation with wing-borne cruise efficiency, arranged to do so with no mechanism that reorients a propulsor, and an account of what the combination costs.**

Each half of that has a named opponent and neither half is a record. **Nor is the configuration claimed to be without precedent**: Section 1 sets out what is already established, including uncrewed tail-sitters, tail-sitters without control surfaces, coaxial contra-rotating tail-sitter propulsion, and blended-wing-body tail-sitters. **The contribution is the architecture, and the paper presents it as the combination, the consequences of the choices inside it, and the accounting** — which is what Sections 5.1 and 5.2 describe and what Section 7.2 prices.

The configuration is arranged to change regime by rotating the airframe rather than the propulsors, and so carries none of the mechanism classes Section 5.1 counts: no pivot, no nacelle or rotor-group actuator, no variable-pitch hub, no dedicated lift rotors, and — while the tip pairs free-wheel or are held by motor torque — no rotor stowing, indexing or stopping mechanism (Section 5.1's note). **This is a count of mechanism classes, not a claim that nothing moves, and not a claim of mechanical simplicity or reliability.** Whether this aircraft completes the rotation is a separate question, and it is not settled here.

## 7. The calculations

Because the comparative result depends on the sizing contract, **no comparison in this paper should be quoted without the contract it was computed under.**
