## S1. The 1954 programmes and the reviews of them (from Section 1)

#### The third route is established, and its history is not what it is usually taken to be

There is a third way to put one set of propulsors into both regimes without reorienting them:
**point the thrust line at the ground and let the whole aircraft rotate.** It is neither new nor
untried nor abandoned. Two American prototypes flew it in 1954, **and uncrewed tail-sitters have
revisited it continuously since.** The Lockheed XFV-1 never
completed the cycle. The Convair XFY-1 did: it flew vertically in August 1954, and six
transitions to conventional flight were completed.

**Why that programme stopped matters, because the usual account is wrong.** Two NASA reviews of
United States V/STOL development — one written largely from the reviewer's own flight-test
experience — judge the configuration itself favourably, calling it a *"good configuration
arrangement for low- and high-speed compatibility."* What they judge poorly is the machinery and
the cockpit around it: *"poor mechanical control system features including low actuator response
rate"*, difficulty hovering precisely over a spot, tip-over tendencies on the ground in gusty
air. The landing difficulty is attributed to *"the unusual spatial orientation where the pilot
looked over his shoulder and down"*, to turbulence sensitivity, and to reduced control power
near touchdown.

And the reason testing ended is recorded identically in both reviews:

> *"Six transitions to conventional flight were successfully completed **before testing was
> curtailed because of engine and gear-box reliability problems**."*

The pilot workload was real, separately documented and severe. **But it is not what curtailed the
testing.** The reviews record a longer list of handling and control difficulties than this section
reproduces, and no attempt is made here to sort them into those that would and would not recur —
what the record settles is the cause of the curtailment, and that cause was mechanical.

#### What the history does not excuse

It would be too convenient to conclude that every one of those programmes ended for reasons
outside its configuration, and this paper does not conclude it. **Some of the difficulties were
real, internal, and are inherited here.** A tail-sitting vertical descent is genuinely harder
than a runway landing. A tail-sitting aircraft on the ground is more exposed to crosswind than a
conventional one. And a set of propellers whose thrust vectors are all parallel to the body axis
produces no rolling moment **by any combination of thrust settings** — which applies to the
configuration described later exactly as it applied to its predecessors. **The reaction-torque
channel that other coaxial tail-sitters use about that same axis is a separate matter, and it is a
choice this configuration declines rather than a limit it inherits; Section 7 says so and Section 9
says what declining it leaves uncounted.**

What the record does show is that **the obstacle that ended the flying was mechanical**, and
that one of the documented handling obstacles — the pilot's spatial orientation and workload —
is removed by an uncrewed aircraft. **The others are not removed by anything.** Precise hovering,
ground gusts and the absence of a thrust-borne rolling moment are configuration facts, and they
are inherited.

Three things are available now that were not: electric drive on each individual rotor,
sensor-based attitude reference, and enough onboard computation that stability need not come
from the airframe alone. **The uncrewed tail-sitter literature has been exploiting exactly those
three for over a decade**, which is why the gap below is not a historical one.

## S3. The departures as a table (from Section 3)

| Departure | What it costs |
|---|---|
| **Different hardware** | Bills 1 and 2. The unused set is carried for the whole flight and, if exposed, drags. |
| **Same hardware, but it serves only one duty** | Bills 1 and 2 again. A propulsor that lifts and is then carried is a dedicated lift group under another name, whatever it shares with the cruise system. |
| **Same hardware, both duties, different orientation** | The tilting family. **Bill 3 is left standing unless a store supplies the hover peak**, and the mechanism that changes the orientation is itself mass, complexity and a control problem through the turn. |
| **Same hardware, both duties, one orientation, different sizing point** | Bill 3 — unless the hover peak is supplied from somewhere other than the continuously installed power. |

## S4. The independent check: the table, the weight breakdown, and the quadrotor contrast (from Section 4)

| Configuration | Effective L/D | Design gross weight | Dedicated lift group |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Turboshaft quadrotor | 4.9 | 3 678 lb | none — the rotors serve both regimes |
| **Turbo-electric lift-plus-cruise** | **8.5** | **7 271 lb** | **yes** — eight lift motors and a cruise motor |
| **Turbo-electric tilt-wing** | **8.6** | **6 584 lb** | **none** — eight proprotors, reoriented |

**The weight breakdown shows the transfer, and it does not close on the categories the table
reports.** Of the empty-weight difference of 679 lb, structure accounts for 716 lb in the
lift-plus-cruise entry's disfavour, propulsion returns 146 lb of it because the tilt-wing's
mechanism is heavier, and battery returns a further 10 lb. **Those three categories account for
580 lb of the 679**; the remaining 99 lb lies in empty-weight categories the published table does
not break out, and this work does not know how it is distributed. **What the three reported
categories do show is the transfer property of Section 2 — the mechanism giving part of the
structural saving back — visible inside a weight breakdown this work did not produce.**

**The quadrotor row is retained as a contrast rather than as the test.** Against it the
lift-plus-cruise configuration is about three-quarters better in cruise efficiency — a factor of
1.74 — and nearly twice as heavy, a factor of 1.98. That is the prediction, and it is worth
being explicit about why it is not a counter-example to it: the efficiency credit is exactly
what the accounting says a dedicated lift system buys, and the weight charge is exactly what it
says the buyer pays. The charge survives the credit.

**But that contrast changes three things at once** — dedicated lift group, powertrain, and
whether a cruise wing exists at all — so it supports a weaker proposition than the prediction as
stated: that adding a wing and a lift group together still costs mass. Section 2 had already
called that much obvious. **It is reported for scale, and the isolation test above is what
carries the prediction.**

## S11. The zero-lift drag build-up as a table (from Section 11)

| | favourable end | adverse end |
|---|---:|---:|
| Clean wetted surface | 0.0073 | 0.0142 |
| Hub and small items | 0.0015 | 0.0022 |
| **Tip frames** | **0.0043** | **0.0047** |
| **Attitude rotors, free-wheeling** | **0.0154** | **0.0169** |

## S13. Sensitivity of the lift-plus-cruise comparison (from Section 13)

| Case | Fixed fuel fraction | Fixed fuel mass | Fixed take-off mass | Shift, first to third |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| As above | +55 to +84 % | +28 to +54 % | −13 to +7 % | 67 to 77 points |
| Lift group 5 % of take-off mass | +55 to +84 % | +47 to +76 % | +36 to +65 % | 14 to 24 points |
| Lift group 15 % of take-off mass | +55 to +84 % | +8 to +31 % | −62 to −50 % | 117 to 134 points |
| All three at this configuration's propeller efficiency | +33 to +45 % | +6 to +17 % | −33 to −25 % | 65 to 72 points |
| Lift-plus-cruise drag as a fixed increment, not a ratio | +59 to +75 % | +31 to +45 % | −13 to +5 % | 67 to 75 points |

*(Range of the lift-plus-cruise layout relative to this configuration, across the four closures.)*

## S14. What is not known, what each item bears on, and what would settle it (from Section 14)

| Item | Bears on | What would settle it |
|---|---|---|
| **The pitching moment through the transition.** Three methods of three fidelities diverge above about ten degrees of incidence; the rotation passes through that band, peaking near 18 to 22 degrees on the 50 kg reference geometry, with the inboard half of the wing in the slipstream at a much lower effective incidence. | Whether the aircraft trims through the rotation (Sections 7 and 10) | **Validated aerodynamic data**: a measurement of the outboard wing's pitching moment to about 22 degrees at low dynamic pressure and of trim at the attached-flow end of the rotation, or a higher-fidelity method validated against one |
| **Section drag at low Reynolds number.** The attitude rotors' free-wheeling charge rests on section polars below a Reynolds number of 10⁵, and the uncertainty runs both ways. | The 0.0154 rotor term in every closure (Sections 10 and 11) and the size of Bill 2's fall with scale (Section 12) | **Validated data**: the drag of a free-wheeling attitude rotor, or of its sections, at about 8 × 10⁴, or a method validated there |
| **The tip pairs' other cruise state.** Free-wheeling is determinate and computed; stopped is a family of states whose means and azimuth are not fixed (Section 8). | Whether a lower-drag cruise state is available, and at what mechanism cost | **Analysis**, or a measurement of one stopped state |
| **The buffer's energy, not only its power.** The store is sized here by power. Whether it also holds the energy for the vertical phases and their reserves, and how it is recharged in cruise, depends on a hover duration this work does not fix; at the bench rate the unit pack emptied in about four minutes. | Whether the store sized by power is also large enough | **Analysis** against a defined mission profile |
| **The electrical path at peak.** Machines, power electronics, wiring and their cooling carry the full take-off demand; they enter the loop as a mass fraction, not as components sized for that peak and its heat. | Whether the path that delivers the buffer's power exists at the mass assumed | **Component sizing and thermal analysis** |
| **The airframe's mass.** It enters the loop as a construction constant, thirty percent of take-off mass (Section 11). A component build-up at the reference mass leaves room for the 13 kg payload only if the average shell areal density stays at or below 1.78 kg m⁻², against 1.50 assumed; the build-up carries a contingency rather than a structural sizing, and it has not been re-run at Section 10's closed masses, still less at the masses the store re-closure returns. At the 1 000 kg reference design the shell-mass exponent is not measured at all. | Every closed mass | **Structural sizing** (analysis), then a **built article** (measurement) |
| **The strip and the fairing.** The strip's effect on this planform is computed, not measured, and its actuation is carried in the systems budget without being sized (Section 11); the fairing is sized against a published stability criterion, and the side force it develops is not measured. | The strip: the body roll axis, which appears as bank in cruise and as a change of heading in hover (Section 8). The fairing: directional stability in cruise | **Measurement** of both surfaces; **sizing** of the actuation |
| **Closed-loop hover control**, including the cost of declining the reaction-torque channel, the absorption of the hover torque residual left by trimming each pair's torque balance at cruise (Section 8), and the allocation of the tip pairs between take-off margin and attitude authority, which compete for the same propellers. | Whether hover is controllable with the authority computed (Sections 5 and 8) | **Analysis not yet done**: a control-allocation study, then simulation |
| **Vertical descent and the landing transition.** Neither is analysed; the vortex ring state is not assessed, and the landing transition is not the take-off transition run backwards. | Whether the aircraft can come down as it went up (Section 5) | **Analysis not yet done** |
| **Ground handling and landing loads.** The stance base is a parameter against static crosswind (Section 5); the response to a landing with lateral velocity or on uneven ground, and handling between flights, are not assessed. | Operation from unprepared sites | **Analysis not yet done** |
| **The competitor's lift-group mass.** It decides the sign of the fixed-take-off-mass ordering in Section 13. | Section 13's sensitivity, not a claim | **Measured inventories** of lift-plus-cruise aircraft of this class |
| **Engine installation** — bay, intake, exhaust, cooling. | Mass, drag and packaging | **Absent from this work entirely** |
| **Blade-family selection.** The criteria that would choose among the blade families — structural loads, acoustics, the motor operating point, rotor inertia, manufacture — are not modelled (Section 10). | Which point of the envelope the aircraft occupies | **Analysis not yet done** |
| **Atmosphere.** Every number here is at sea level; the configuration's own altitude sensitivity has been computed for hover power and propeller efficiency, its effect on the Section 6 comparison has not. | The comparison in Section 6, made against a mission flown at altitude | **Analysis**: the direction of the effect has not been computed |
