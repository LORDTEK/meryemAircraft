The basis is not symmetric. The lift-plus-cruise layout carries a lift-to-drag ratio transferred from a different airframe's
wind-tunnel campaign (Section 2.1), and its stopped lift rotors take an indexing mechanism (Section 5.1) whose mass is not charged. **The
tilting layout carries no cruise drag penalty at all. That is an idealisation in its favour**, and it makes the tilting layout a bound.
Both competitors are given a propeller efficiency of 0.80, assumed, against this configuration's computed 0.632 and 0.683, and a lift
group of 10 percent or a tilt mechanism of 5 percent of take-off mass. **Neither figure is measured.**

#### Against lift-plus-cruise: a trade, and the contract sets the exchange rate

**The two architectures trade one charge against another**: closed under a fixed fuel fraction, this configuration is 27 to 30 percent lighter, and the lift-plus-cruise layout cruises at a lift-to-drag ratio of 11.66 and 15.72 against 8.79 and 10.82, with a propeller at 0.80.

**The lift-plus-cruise layout is 55 to 84 percent ahead under the first contract, 28 to 54 percent under the second, and between 13 percent short and 7 percent ahead under the third; the shift from first to third is 67 to 77 percentage points at every closure**, at the declared lift-group fraction, and always toward the lighter aircraft. The per-closure numbers are in Supplement S13. **The sign itself changes inside the envelope under the third contract**: this configuration is ahead at the two closures with the higher-efficiency blade family and behind at the two with the lower. **A statement of which architecture has the longer range, made without its contract, would therefore be a statement about the contract.**

#### Against the tilting layout: a bound, not a ranking

**What the bound gives is a size, not an order.** Credited with no cruise penalty, the tilting layout is 93 to 141 percent ahead of this configuration under every contract at every closure; that margin is the room a real tilting aircraft's cruise penalties — nacelle drag, pivot fairing, hover-sized rotors flown as cruise propellers — would have to fill, and how much of it they fill is not computed. **A ranking against a competitor modelled as a bound is not a ranking, and no range claim is made against the tilting family in either direction.**

#### Section 2.1's prediction, tested

Section 2.1 predicted that such a ranking will move when the sizing rule changes, and can reverse. **The movement holds
everywhere**, against both competitors, toward the lighter arrangement as the contract weights mass more; **the reversal holds at two of
the four closures against lift-plus-cruise, and at none against the tilt bound.** Where it falls is decided by quantities this study
has not measured or fixed: the blade family in the base case, and across the sensitivity cases the competitor's lift-group mass and the
propeller basis (Supplement S13). **Which architecture ranks first under a fixed take-off mass is therefore decided, in this model,
by quantities this study assumes for the competitor rather than measures: its lift-group mass fraction and its propeller efficiency.**
What is robust is that the shift exists and runs toward the lighter aircraft.

#### What the framework asks of whoever uses it

**Each comparison states every charge in its own currency before any aggregate, names its contract, and states its asymmetries and their directions; an ordering is reported only with the contract it was computed under and, where its sign depends on an unmeasured quantity, with that quantity named.** This paper meets that for its own column (Section 6.2) and not for the competitors', whose kilograms and drag counts here are parameters and transferred ratios rather than an audit.

#### What this section does not establish

**The competitors are modelled at a coarser level than this configuration**: their drag is transferred or idealised, their propeller efficiency assumed and their architecture-specific mass a parameter. **Comparing computed figures against assumed ones favours whichever is assumed more optimistically** — in propeller efficiency both competitors, and with a common propeller efficiency the lift-plus-cruise lead under the first contract falls from 55–84 to 33–45 percent (Supplement S13); in drag the tilting layout, by assumption. **The comparison is at one size**: Section 6.3's 1 000 kg reference design has no closure, and none of its figures is used here. **And nothing here ranks architectures for a mission.** What this section establishes is narrower: **the same aircraft, under three reasonable contracts, give orderings against lift-plus-cruise that move by tens of percentage points and, inside the envelope, change sign** — so the ordering is not a property of the architectures alone.

## 7. What does not close

Section 6.1 closed the sizing loop on a declared package and said that whether an aircraft can be built to it is a different question. **This section is where that question is answered, and for the first item the answer is no: the required store performance is not demonstrated by the sources consulted here.** It is stated in that order — first the obstacle that is known, then what is not known.

### First, the known obstacle: the energy store

**Every closure in Section 6.1 carries a buffer of 3.6 percent of take-off mass.** Taken at the
electrical bus, **the four closures ask the buffer for 4.7 to 5.2 kW per kilogram of buffer to hover, and 5.5 to 6.1 kW per kilogram of
buffer to leave the ground** with the tip pairs at full thrust (Section 3).

**What has been measured is a fraction of that, and the store figures available are of four different kinds.** A pack flown in a 210 kg-class electric VTOL aircraft is rated, as a flown system, at 0.892 kW per kilogram continuous; its
unit pack, discharged on the bench at its highest tested rate, delivered on average about 1.5 kW per kilogram (Supplement S14). A
NASA-funded design study adopts 4 kW per kilogram and describes that figure as about twice that of existing batteries. The same study
notes lithium-polymer figures in the literature as high as 3 kW per kilogram, which it cites rather than measures; against that figure
the take-off demand is 1.8 to 2.0 times. The study argues that, because pulse current limits can exceed continuous ones — by more than a
factor of two in one commercial module it cites — a pack with the required specific power may be possible with existing technology; its
hover lasts twenty seconds or less, while this aircraft's vertical phases occupy about a minute in all (Section 2.1), and how long each
draws the peak is not computed here.

**The take-off demand is 3.7 to 4.1 times the bench rate — the highest figure obtained from a measurement — and 6.2 to 6.8 times the
flown system's continuous rating.** The comparison is between unlike ratings. **The gap is real on every one of them;
the factor quoted is peak demand against bench average.** The package Section 6.1 closes on does not exist with any store the sources
consulted here report as built; closed again at the bench rate, it becomes 76 to 81 percent heavier, a sensitivity with one input
changed rather than a structural closure (Supplement S14).

**This is where the coupling Section 2.2 names is paid**: the buffer converts kilowatts of hover peak into kilograms of store. **The
escape from Bill 3 is real in the sense Section 2.2 defined it, and its price depends on a component whose required performance has not
been demonstrated.**

### What the obstacle reaches, and what it does not

**It reaches every number that describes this aircraft at Section 6.1's masses**: the closed masses of 52.3 to 57.5 kg and the 13 kg payload assume the store. The ranges of 927 to 1 233 km survive the re-closure only because the fuel fraction is held, on an aircraft three-quarters heavier; they do not survive as 13 kg carried that far on a store that has been built. The vertical phase that Section 3 reports as sized was sized with this store in it, and Section 6.4's orderings were computed with the store held common at 3.6 percent; how they would move with a measured store is not computed.

**It does not reach the mechanism claim.** That is a statement about hardware, and a heavier store adds no pivot. **Nor does it reach the cruise-efficiency comparison of Section 4 as a ratio**: effective lift-to-drag ratio has no mass in it. As a comparison of aircraft, that section describes the configuration at Section 6.1's masses, which the store does reach.

### Then what is not known

Eighteen further questions are open, and Supplement S14 lists each with what it bears on and what would settle it.

**None of these is a small correction to a known quantity.** Two of them need validated data rather than more of the computation already done: the transition moment, because three methods have been tried against it and disagree, and the low-Reynolds section drag, because the one method used here is least reliable exactly there.

### What this section amounts to

**The loop closes; the aircraft is not shown to.** At the energy store the paper can name the gap exactly, in specific power and in take-off mass; everywhere else it can name only what would settle the question. **The architecture claim — that the configuration is arranged to change regime with no mechanism that reorients a propulsor — is a count of hardware, and nothing in this section reaches it.** What this section reaches is the aircraft, and the paper has not claimed the aircraft. The last section returns to the four axes and states what is claimed on each.

## 8. Four axes, and where the paper stops

This section states the boundary of the paper's claims.

**It is not a list of the study's open questions.** Those are in Section 7, and the difference matters: the boundary below is about claims the paper **declines to make**, most of which it could not make on any evidence; Section 7 is about questions the paper **does not answer**, and which better evidence would answer. One is a scope; the other is a debt.

### The claims are made on four axes, against four different opponents

Comparison is only meaningful against a named alternative, and this paper's alternatives differ from axis to axis.

| Axis | Opponent | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Cruise efficiency | Rotorcraft: multirotors and helicopters | **Claimed against multirotors, and bounded; against helicopters the comparison with published figures is mixed and no advantage is claimed.** Cruise lift is carried on a surface rather than on rotors, which no sizing contract changes. The *size* of the resulting advantage is a calculation, not a consequence of that fact: positive throughout against one published quadrotor, and from slightly behind to comfortably ahead against the other (Section 4). |
| Operation without a runway | Fixed-wing aircraft | **Claimed as sized, not demonstrated** (Sections 3, 7). The vertical phase was sized with an energy store whose required performance the sources consulted here do not report as built. |
| The mechanism required to change regime | Tilting architectures | **Claimed.** This is the paper's contribution — a count of mechanism classes (Section 5.1), not a claim of mechanical simplicity or reliability. |
| Cruise efficiency and range | Other hybrids — lift-plus-cruise, tilt | **Not claimed, in either direction.** |

**The fourth row is the important one**, and the reason it is a refusal rather than a result is the paper's own finding in Section 6.4. Against lift-plus-cruise the ordering depends on the sizing contract: across the three contracts it moves substantially, and under one of them its sign changes inside the envelope and turns on quantities of the competitor that are assumed rather than measured. A paper that quoted one of those orderings as a result would be reporting its own choice of contract. Against the tilting family the competitor can be modelled here only as a bound that pays no cruise penalty, and an ordering against a bound is not a result. **No range claim is made against the tilting or lift-plus-cruise families in either direction**, and a reader who finds one implied anywhere in this paper should treat it as an error rather than as a claim.

### What each claim does not depend on

**Operation without a runway** does not depend on the drag bracket, the propeller efficiency or the transition aerodynamics — **but it does depend on the energy store**: the vertical phase is sized with one, and Section 7 examines whether it exists. **Cruise lift carried on a surface** does not depend on the sizing contract or the transition aerodynamics. The **size** of the cruise-efficiency margin depends on both the drag bracket and the blade family, and Section 4 reports it as a range rather than a number. **Elimination of the propulsor-reorientation mechanism class** does not depend on the drag bracket, the propeller efficiency, the sizing contract, the range result or the energy store — **nor on the transition aerodynamics**.

The mechanism claim is a statement about what hardware is present, and it is settled by the inventory of Sections 5.1 and 5.2. **The separate claim that this aircraft can actually perform the regime change is not settled** (Section 5.1).

### One cost of the contribution that is named and not priced

The mechanism claim has a price this work does not compute. **This configuration declines the reaction-torque channel that comparable aircraft use for roll (Section 5.2). What that refusal costs — in thrust asymmetry, in propulsive efficiency, and in response time set by rotor inertia — is not computed anywhere in this paper.** The claim is that the mechanism class is eliminated. **Whether eliminating it is favourable on balance is a question this work does not settle**, and quantifying it would require a control-allocation study rather than a single torque figure.

### Eight things this paper does not claim

**1. It does not claim range against fixed-wing aircraft.**

**2. It does not claim vertical capability against rotorcraft.** That comparison runs the other way.

**3. It does not claim that the aircraft has no moving parts.** What is eliminated is a *class of mechanism* — the one that reorients a propulsor. The aircraft has a moving aerodynamic surface, it is named where the elimination is claimed rather than later, and it also pitches the nose down when deployed.

**4. It does not claim mechanical simplicity.** Part count, assembly mass, failure modes and maintenance burden were not measured, and nothing here supports a statement about reliability. The count of mechanism classes in Section 5.1 is not a reliability argument.

**5. It does not claim that the escape condition is fully instantiated.** The condition is met in the propulsor that carries the aircraft and is not met in the attitude system, which is carried through cruise producing moments rather than cruise thrust. Section 2.2 names that case as partial instantiation, and the charge it re-opens is reported rather than absorbed.

**6. It does not claim that satisfying the condition makes an aircraft better.** The condition concerns three specific charges. A configuration may avoid all three and still be unbuildable, uncontrollable, or unsuited to its mission, and the accounting says nothing against that possibility.

**7. It does not claim that the trades inside the escape are favourable.** Moving the hover peak onto a store converts a power-system charge into a cost in kilograms; serving two regimes with one set of fixed-geometry propellers costs efficiency in at least one of them. Both are computed, neither is asserted to be worth paying, and the ledger reports them whichever way they fall.

**8. It does not claim that the aircraft flies.** The design *sizes* vertical operation and the transition; it does not demonstrate either. No aircraft has been built, no wind tunnel has been run on this geometry, and the transition analysis is a calculation whose assumptions are stated where it appears.

### What the claims that remain amount to

Section 7 and Supplement S14 list what the paper leaves open. What the paper offers is **a configuration sized to combine runway-independent vertical operation with wing-borne cruise efficiency, arranged to do so with no mechanism that reorients a propulsor, and an account of what the combination costs.**

Each half of that has a named opponent and neither half is a record. **Nor is the configuration claimed to be without precedent**: Section 1 sets out what is already established, including uncrewed tail-sitters, tail-sitters without control surfaces, coaxial contra-rotating tail-sitter propulsion, and blended-wing-body tail-sitters. **The contribution is the architecture, and the paper presents it as the combination, the consequences of the choices inside it, and the accounting** — which is what Sections 5.1 and 5.2 describe and what Section 6.2 prices.

The configuration is arranged to change regime by rotating the airframe rather than the propulsors, and so carries none of the mechanism classes Section 5.1 counts: no pivot, no nacelle or rotor-group actuator, no variable-pitch hub, no dedicated lift rotors, and — while the tip pairs free-wheel or are held by motor torque — no rotor stowing, indexing or stopping mechanism (Section 5.1's note). **This is a count of mechanism classes, not a claim that nothing moves, and not a claim of mechanical simplicity or reliability.** Whether this aircraft completes the rotation is a separate question, and it is not settled here.

### S2. The charges: working for Section 2.1

#### The power ratio

> *Provenance and changes:* for P01: "The ratio between the two demands follows from the governing equations rather than from any design choice (Supplement S2)". src: paper/v8/supplement.md, "Section 2 as it stood before recomposition into result sentences", Bill 3 (L756-L771). Verbatim except the Section number.

Taking hover power from momentum theory and cruise power from the drag polar,

    P_hover / W  = √(DL / 2ρ) / η_h                 (DL = W/A, disc loading)
    P_cruise / W = V / ((L/D) η_p)

so that

    P_hover / P_cruise = √(DL / 2ρ) · (L/D) / V · (η_p / η_h)

A vehicle with a disc loading of 100 N m⁻², a cruise lift-to-drag ratio of 15 and a cruise speed of 30 m s⁻¹ needs between three and four times as much power to hover as to cruise: the geometric terms alone give 3.2, and the efficiency ratio η_p/η_h carries it to about four when the cruise propeller is roughly a quarter more efficient than the hover rotor.

#### The transfer with direct experimental support

> *Provenance and changes:* for P02: "One of these transfers has direct experimental support (Supplement S2)". src: same snapshot, "The charges are coupled" (L805-L812). Change: dash pair -> parentheses (E33, protected S2 row, format only). ADDED (source fact, for reader vote): "and deducted from the battery mass" -- Bacchini thesis eq. (81), paper/bacchini-reading-record.md 5.2.

In the doctoral study whose wind-tunnel campaign Section 2.1 quotes [14], and in that document rather than in the journal article by the same author, which reports a different comparison, a retraction system removed thirty percent of the airframe's drag; the same work then costed it. Applied to a passenger eVTOL, with the mechanism assessed at five percent of vehicle mass and deducted from the battery mass, maximum range rose from 119 km to 121 km: a two-kilometre gain for a five-percent mass penalty. The same work finds the retraction's advantage elsewhere (the speed that maximises range rose by 5 m/s), which is a performance this accounting does not price. Bill 2 was converted almost exactly into Bill 1, and the transfer is the point rather than the small residue.

#### The tilting row

> *Provenance and changes:* for P03: "The tilting row, which needs both clarifications, is worked through in Supplement S2". src: same snapshot, "One row pays part of its cost…" (L795-L801), "Two clarifications…" (L822-L832), "The tilting row needs both clarifications" (L834-L839). Protected S2 rows (E16) carried, format only (E33). ADDED connector sentence (for reader vote): "The two clarifications of Section 2.1 apply to it as follows."

What a tilting architecture buys its unified propulsion group with is a mechanism: a pivot, an actuator, the gyroscopic coupling of a reorienting mass, and a control problem through the turn. The pivot and the actuator are paid in kilograms, although they are not lift-subsystem mass; the coupling and the control problem are paid in none of the three.

The two clarifications of Section 2.1 apply to it as follows. "No worse" is judged against the architecture the move modifies. A charge that architecture already paid, left no larger, is no worse. A charge it did not pay, imposed by the move, is worse; so is one it paid, enlarged by it. A remedy whose cost falls outside the three charges does not refute the accounting, but it is not thereby exempt from being counted. A framework that could absorb any cost by declaring it out-of-scope would be unfalsifiable, so the costs outside the three are listed, not waved away.

The tilting row needs both clarifications. If the architecture it modifies supplies its hover peak from a store, tilting without one imposes Bill 3 and the row is a transfer between charges. If that architecture already sizes its continuous plant by the hover peak, tilting leaves Bill 3 no worse; then, where the mechanism's kilograms are fewer than those of the lift group it removes, what keeps the row from refuting the accounting is the part of its cost that falls outside the three, which is why that part is listed.

### S3. The condition: working for Section 2.2

#### What each departure costs

> *Provenance and changes:* for P04: "What each departure costs is in Supplement S3". src: paper/v8/supplement.md S3 working part, the departures table (L921-L926); the note from "Section 3 as it stood before recomposition…" (L1096-L1100). Change: one dash -> comma (row 4).

| Departure | What it costs |
|---|---|
| Different hardware | Bills 1 and 2. The unused set is carried for the whole flight and, if exposed, drags. |
| Same hardware, but it serves only one duty | Bills 1 and 2 again. A propulsor that lifts and is then carried is a dedicated lift group under another name, whatever it shares with the cruise system. |
| Same hardware, both duties, different orientation | The tilting family. Bill 3 is incurred unless a store supplies the hover peak, and the mechanism that changes the orientation adds mass and introduces a control problem through the turn. |
| Same hardware, both duties, one orientation, different sizing point | Bill 3, unless the hover peak is supplied from somewhere other than the continuously installed power. |

The second departure is stated separately because it does real work later: a propulsor that produces a little thrust in cruise is not thereby serving both duties, and the distinction decides which parts of a configuration meet the condition and which do not.

#### The six permitted costs

> *Provenance and changes:* for P05: "Six costs are permitted, named here before any candidate is examined (the working is in Supplement S3)". src: "Section 3 as it stood before recomposition into result sentences", the six bullets (L1131-L1180) and the failure-mode note (L1199-L1201). BROUGHT UP TO THE CURRENT BODY (superseded wording not carried): (3) snapshot "it is priced where the transition is analysed" -> current body "Section 6.1 analyses the transition without pricing it" (Round 191, row 0); (5) snapshot "Attitude devices produce thrust in cruise" -> current body "produce no cruise thrust in that sense" (the tip pairs free-wheel at zero shaft torque in cruise, Round 130-131); (6) "Section 11" -> "Section 6.2".  Protected S3 row (E17) carried. Dashes -> parentheses or colons.

1) **A store.** It has the same duty-cycle character as Bill 1. The fourth part moves the hover peak off the continuous power plant and onto a store; that store delivers its peak for two percent of the flight and is carried for the rest. It is not Bill 1 as Section 2.1 defines it (it is not lift-subsystem mass), but it is mass carried for a duty that is briefly needed, which is the same complaint Bill 1 makes. The condition converts a power-system charge into a cost in kilograms and claims only that the three charges as named are not incurred. It does not claim the trade is favourable. Whether the store is lighter than the continuous power it displaces is a sizing result and is computed, not asserted.

2) **The electrical path.** The fourth part frees the continuous power plant from the hover peak. Everything between the store and the rotors (machines, power electronics, wiring) still passes the full hover power and is still sized by it. That is Bill 3 on the electrical path, and the condition does not remove it; it is carried in the ledger rather than in this definition.

3) **Rotating the airframe.** The condition refuses architectures that reorient a propulsor, and sets that refusal against the mechanism a tilt requires. An architecture that instead rotates its whole body faces the same physical problem: a ninety-degree change of the thrust axis relative to the flight path, with the moments, the authority and the control through the turn that implies. It is not one of the three charges and the condition does not eliminate it; Section 6.1 analyses the transition without pricing it. Saying otherwise would let a candidate win that line by wording.

4) **Hardware installed for the vertical phase that serves both duties.** The second departure is what carries the weight of this permission.

5) **Hardware used in both regimes for something other than propulsive thrust.** Cruise thrust in this paper means the thrust that balances cruise drag. Attitude devices produce no cruise thrust in that sense; they are used throughout the flight, so their duty cycle matches their presence and they fall outside Bill 1. They remain in the airstream, so the second charge reaches them. Attitude hardware does not stop the propulsor that carries the aircraft from meeting the condition, but it is carried through cruise without producing cruise thrust, which is the first failure mode of Section 2.2, and the charges are about everything the aircraft carries, so Bill 2 reaches it. An architecture in that position is a partial instantiation, the fourth failure mode: it meets the condition where it carries the aircraft and still pays one of the three elsewhere. The fourth failure mode is not a technicality. An architecture may meet the condition where it carries the aircraft and fail it elsewhere, and a paper that reported only the first half would be reporting the condition rather than the aircraft.

6) **The price of serving two regimes with one set of hardware.** Hardware that is not duplicated cannot be optimised twice: a propeller sized for hover thrust at zero forward speed is not the propeller a cruise design would choose, and if its geometry is fixed the compromise is paid in efficiency. The condition permits that cost and does not measure it. Section 6.2 does.

### S4. The independent check: working for Section 2.3

#### The published designs used

> *Provenance and changes:* for P06: "The working is in Supplement S4". src: paper/v8/supplement.md S4 working part, table (L1275-L1279); figures checked against the source in this round: Johnson & Silva [16], Table 3, p. 70 (references/1521_Johnson & Silva_122721.pdf): L/De 4.9 / 8.5 / 8.6; DGW 3,678 / 7,271 / 6,584 lb.

| Configuration (NASA sizing set [16]) | Effective L/D | Design gross weight | Dedicated lift group |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Turboshaft quadrotor | 4.9 | 3 678 lb | none; the rotors serve both regimes |
| Turbo-electric lift-plus-cruise | 8.5 | 7 271 lb | yes: eight lift motors and a cruise motor |
| Turbo-electric tilt-wing | 8.6 | 6 584 lb | none: eight proprotors, reoriented |

#### Why the second half of the prediction is not derived

> *Provenance and changes:* src: "Section 4's paragraphs as they stood before the Round 184 shortening" (L1514) and "…before the Round 167 recomposition" (L1466). Protected S4 rows (E20) carried: the counter-set and "None is known to the authors." Change: "the mission used below" -> "the mission of Section 2.3"; dash -> colon.

Section 2.1 predicts the charge and the amplification; it does not prove that the credit must lose. A dedicated lift system raises the empty-mass fraction and may lower the energy fraction at the same time, and which wins is a closure result rather than a consequence of the accounting. If some data set showed the credit covering the charge, Bill 1 would not be refuted: the mass would still have been paid. What would be refuted is the expectation that the amplified charge outweighs the linear credit. A long enough mission is where the credit is most likely to cover the charge, and the mission of Section 2.3 is short. The counter-set is therefore a common-mission sizing study at longer range in which a dedicated-lift configuration is both more efficient and no heavier than one without. None is known to the authors.

#### The weight breakdown

> *Provenance and changes:* for P07: "… the remaining 99 lb lies in categories it does not break out (Supplement S4)". src: S4 working part (L1281-L1287), CORRECTED against the source (S-64): the archive wrote "battery returns a further 10 lb"; the source gives battery 254 lb (lift-plus-cruise) against 244 lb (tilt-wing), so it ADDS 10 lb in the lift-plus-cruise entry's disfavour. Check: structure 2,670 − 1,954 = 716; propulsion 1,772 − 1,918 = −146; battery 254 − 244 = +10; 716 − 146 + 10 = 580; empty 5,809 − 5,130 = 679.

Of the empty-weight difference of 679 lb, structure accounts for 716 lb in the lift-plus-cruise entry's disfavour, propulsion returns 146 lb of it because the tilt-wing's mechanism is heavier, and battery adds a further 10 lb. Those three categories account for 580 lb of the 679; the remaining 99 lb lies in empty-weight categories the published table does not break out, and this work does not know how it is distributed. What the three reported categories do show is the transfer property of Section 2.1 (the mechanism giving part of the structural saving back), visible inside a weight breakdown this work did not produce.

#### The source's own statement

> *Provenance and changes:* src: "Section 4's paragraphs as they stood before the Round 184 shortening" (L1518). Protected S4 rows (E20) carried verbatim. Quotation checked this round: references/1521_Johnson & Silva_122721.pdf, text lines 495-496 ("… but not enough to counter the increase in structure and propulsion weight").

And the source states the second half of the prediction in its own words, on a comparison the check does not use as its test. Discussing why the all-electric lift-plus-cruise design is the heaviest in the set, the study writes that the high cruise efficiency of the lift-plus-cruise type reduces battery weight compared with a quadrotor, *"but not enough to counter the increase in structure and propulsion weight."*

#### The quadrotor contrast

> *Provenance and changes:* src: S4 working part (L1289-L1300). Protected S4 row (E13) carried. Dashes -> colon and parentheses. Check: 8.5 / 4.9 = 1.735 -> 1.73 (the archive wrote 1.74: S-65); 7,271 / 3,678 = 1.977 -> 1.98. PROTECTED WORD CHANGE: "the isolation test above" -> "the isolation test of Section 2.3" (the supplement has no test above). Author approved, Round 204 (E34).

The quadrotor is reported for scale, and the isolation test of Section 2.3 is what carries the prediction. Against it the lift-plus-cruise configuration is about three-quarters better in cruise efficiency (a factor of 1.73) and nearly twice as heavy, a factor of 1.98. The efficiency credit is exactly what the accounting says a dedicated lift system buys, and the weight charge is exactly what it says the buyer pays: the charge survives the credit. But that contrast changes three things at once (dedicated lift group, powertrain, and whether a cruise wing exists at all), so it supports a weaker proposition than the prediction as stated: that adding a wing and a lift group together still costs mass.

### S5. The landing transition: working for Section 3

> *Provenance and changes:* for P09: "… the landing transition is not the take-off transition run backwards, and no figure in this paper describes it (Supplement S5)". src: paper/v8/supplement.md, "Section 5 as it stood before the length pass", paragraph "Neither has the landing transition." (L1630-L1636). Changes: the lead "Neither has the landing transition." dropped (the heading carries it); bold removed; the closing clause shortened, since the body already says no figure describes it. No number.

The forward rotation and the reverse are not symmetric and must not be assumed to be. Going out, the rotation builds dynamic pressure while it turns, so lift arrives to replace the vertical component of thrust as that component falls. Coming back, the race runs backwards: dynamic pressure is falling while the aircraft is being turned, so lift is leaving at the moment the thrust vector has not yet returned to vertical. A model built for the first case cannot be read for the second by changing a sign, and no figure in this paper describes the second.

### S6. The cruise-efficiency comparison: working for Section 4

#### The blade families

> *Provenance and changes:* for P11: "Which blade a designer would choose also turns on structural loads, acoustics, the motor operating point, rotor inertia and manufacture, none of which is modelled in this work (Supplement S6)". src: paper/v8/supplement.md, "Section 6 as it stood before the length pass" (L1830-L1833 and L1856-L1861). Protected S6 row (E13) carried verbatim. Added (working under the body's "four nose-blade families", Section 6.1): the family definitions and each family's efficiency, from aero/nose-propeller-crossing.txt (aero/nose_propeller_crossing.py, rerun this round: identical output; hover figures of merit 0.591 to 0.603 against the target 0.599, the pitch found by a seven-step search). "Section 10 is where …" -> Section 6.1.

The four nose-blade families are two and three blades per rotor, each designed at two target section lift coefficients, 0.55 and 0.70, and each solved at its hover and its cruise condition by blade-element momentum theory. Their cruise propeller efficiencies are 0.648 and 0.683 with two blades and 0.632 and 0.643 with three, at the lower and the higher section lift coefficient respectively. Whether 0.683 is the blade a designer would actually choose is not settled here. It is the best of the four on cruise efficiency under the hover figure-of-merit constraint. Blade count and section loading also govern structural loads, acoustics, the motor operating point, rotor inertia and manufacture, and none of those is modelled in this work. Section 6.1 is where one blade is carried into a closed sizing loop.

#### The compared vehicles

> *Provenance and changes:* for P12: "The compared vehicles are larger than both designs studied here, which are of order 50 kg and 1 000 kg (Supplement S6)". src: paper/v8/supplement.md L1906-L1908 (protected S6 row E13 carried verbatim: "The compared vehicles are 1 660 to 3 275 kg"). Checked this round against Johnson & Silva [16], Table 3, p. 70: rotorcraft design gross weights QSMR 3,951 / 5,980 lb, side-by-side 3,665 / 5,547 lb, quadrotor 3,678 / 7,221 lb; 3,665 lb = 1,662 kg, 7,221 lb = 3,275 kg. Closed masses 52.3 and 57.5 kg: body Section 6.1 table. Change: "across the same bracket" -> "across its four closures" (52.3 kg is closure D, 57.5 kg closure A; they differ in blade as well as drag).
